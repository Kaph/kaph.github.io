          <h3>Statement on medical device app guidelines</h3>
          
          <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (2014)have guidance notes on when a mobile application may constitute a medical device and thus come under the EU medical device directive. After careful consideration of the guidance, I do not believe that tidyResus comes under their requirements. The app does no calculation, does not affect a patient outcome, provides no management or treatment recommendation, and in essence is an administrative record that records no identifiable information. For further information, please contact me.</p>
